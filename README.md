i tend to loose focus while working or even doing something of my own
building this project to be more focused, productive and to keep myself in check

this is supposed to run as a cron job, which keeps on asking me for updates on my tasks and also talks to me about what's going on
helps me manage time and stuff

let's see how quickly i abandon this project XD
i hope that doesn't happen
